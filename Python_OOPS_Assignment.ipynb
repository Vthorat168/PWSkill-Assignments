        "# 1. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)?\n",
        "  - Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses \"objects\", which contain data and methods (functions), to design applications and computer programs\n",
        "\n",
        "# 2. What is a class in OOP?\n",
        "  - In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 3. What is an object in OOP?\n",
        "  - a self-contained unit of code that encapsulates data (attributes or properties) and the methods (functions or behaviors) that operate on that data.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 4.  What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?\n",
        "  - Abstraction focuses on hiding complex implementation details and showing only the essential features of an object, while encapsulation focuses on bundling data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit and controlling access to it\n",
        "\n",
        "# 5.  What are dunder methods in Python?\n",
        "  - Dunder methods, also known as magic methods or special methods, are predefined methods in Python that have double underscores (or \"dunders\") at the beginning and end of their names\n",
        "\n",
        "# 6. Explain the concept of inheritance in OOP.\n",
        "  - Inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a mechanism where a new class (subclass or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from an existing class (parent class or superclass)\n",
        "\n",
        "# 7. What is polymorphism in OOP?\n",
        "  - Polymorphism, in object-oriented programming (OOP), is the ability of a variable, function, or object to take on multiple forms\n",
        "\n",
        "# 8. How is encapsulation achieved in Python?\n",
        "  - Encapsulation in Python is achieved through a combination of conventions and language features, aiming to bundle data (attributes) and methods that operate on that data within a single unit (a class), and control access to the internal state of objects.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 9. What is a constructor in Python?\n",
        "  - a constructor is a special method used to initialize a newly created object of a class. It is automatically called when an object (an instance) of a class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "#  10. What are class and static methods in Python.\n",
        "  - class and static methods are special types of methods within a class that differ in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 11. What is method overloading in Python?\n",
        "  - the ability to define multiple methods within the same class that share the same name but differ in their parameter lists. This allows a single method name to perform different actions based on the number or types of arguments passed to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 12. What is method overriding in OOP?\n",
        "  - method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its parent class (superclass)\n",
        "\n",
        "# 13. What is a property decorator in Python?\n",
        "  - A property decorator in Python, specifically @property, is a built-in decorator that allows methods within a class to be accessed and managed as if they were attributes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 14.  Why is polymorphism important in OOP?\n",
        "  - it allows for increased flexibility, code reusability, and maintainability\n",
        "\n",
        "# 15. What is an abstract class in Python?\n",
        "  - An abstract class in Python is a class that serves as a blueprint or template for other classes. It cannot be instantiated directly, meaning you cannot create objects of an abstract class. Its primary purpose is to define a common interface and enforce certain methods to be implemented by its subclasses.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 16. What are the advantages of OOP?\n",
        "  - (OOP) offers numerous advantages, including improved code organization, reusability, flexibility, and scalability\n",
        "\n",
        "# 17. What is the difference between a class variable and an instance variable.\n",
        "  - Class variables are associated with the class itself and are shared by all instances of that class, while instance variables are specific to each individual object (instance) of the class\n",
        "\n",
        "# 18. What is multiple inheritance in Python?\n",
        "  - Multiple inheritance in Python is a feature where a class can inherit attributes and methods from more than one parent class. This means a single child class can be derived from two or more base classes, combining the functionalities of all its parent classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 19.Explain the purpose of **`__str__`** and **`__repr__`** methods in Python.\n",
        "\n",
        "  -  **`__str__`**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Purpose**: Provides a **user-friendly** string representation of the object.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - **`__repr__`**:\n",
        "\n",
        "    **Purpose**: Provides an **unambiguous** string representation of the object, useful for debugging and development.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 20. What is the significance of the `super()` function in Python.\n",
        "  - Its primary role is to provide access to methods and properties of a parent or sibling class from within a child class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 21. What is the significance of the `__del__` method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __del__ method in Python, also known as a destructor, is a special method that gets called when an object is about to be destroyed or garbage collected. Its primary significance lies in enabling resource cleanup.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 22. What is the difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python?\n",
        "  - The primary difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod in Python lies in how they interact with the class and its instances.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 23. How does polymorphism work in Python with inheritance?\n",
        "  - when combined with inheritance, primarily manifests through method overriding. This allows objects of different classes, related by inheritance, to respond to the same method call in a way specific to their own class.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 24. What is method chaining in Python OOP?\n",
        "  - Method chaining in Python Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a technique that allows for the sequential invocation of multiple methods on a single object within a single line of code. This is achieved by having each method in the chain return the object itself (self) after performing its designated action.\n",
        "\n",
        "# 25. What is the purpose of the `__call__` method in Python?\n",
        "  - The __call__ method in Python is a special \"dunder\" (double underscore) method that allows instances of a class to be treated and invoked like functions. When you define __call__ within a class, you make objects of that class \"callable.\""
